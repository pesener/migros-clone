With this project, I was aiming to clone the most famous supermarket website in Turkey with using TypeScript, React, Redux, TailwindCss, Node.js , MongoDB.

In this project, there are two main files named server and client. The server file was created to use Mongo DB Express.js and Node.js.

On the other hand , the client file has been created to use React, Redux TailwindCss and TypeScript processes, which will create the design and functionality of the site.
